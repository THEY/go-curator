The go-curator framework is a high-level API that simplifies using ZooKeeper in GO, by building features on top of
[go-zookeeper](https://github.com/samuel/go-zookeeper). At this time it is not the goal of go-curator to be in feature
parity with the java project of the same namesake ([curator](http://curator.apache.org))
